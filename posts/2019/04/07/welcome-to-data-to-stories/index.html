        <p>Hello to everyone who is reading this, and welcome to my blog, Data to Stories. This is my attempt at writing an introductory post since it would be weird to dive right into interesting Data Stories.</p>
<p>I am in transition from a 6-year career as an Electrical Engineer in the High Voltage (HV) Power sector to a career in Data Science, and studying at <a href="http://www.thisismetis.com">Metis</a> is helping me achieve that. As part of the curriculum, I am to write a blog about my experience, particularly on some of the projects that I have and will be working on while attending Metis.</p>
<h3><strong>But Why Data to Stories? What does this even mean?</strong></h3>
<p>If you have read this far, you might be wondering, what does the Blog name even mean? Data to Stories? Well, I think it's important that in the first week of studying, the most important phrase I caught from my instructor is to "tell a story"; data science is all about stories I can present to interested parties (i.e. stockholders, clients, even friends!) using the data that I explore and analyze. </p>
<h3><strong>So what can you expect?</strong></h3>
<p>In the next few weeks I will be publishing some findings from the required projects at Metis, and other interesting data I choose to explore afterwards. I will try to encapsulate each of them with a story to go along with it to make it more interesting for you. The intent is to bring you a fresh and interesting perspective on data that you might otherwise find boring. After all, who wants to read boring blog post...right?</p>
<h3><strong>What do I expect from you?</strong></h3>
<p>Well... either encourage me, let me know what you think, or... even just reading is enough for me!</p>
